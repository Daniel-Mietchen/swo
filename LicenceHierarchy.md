# Licence Hierarchy in SWO

Within SWO, software can be related to the licences that describe how that it may be used. The asserted hierarchy is relatively flat, with a simple list of licenses grouped by their owning organizations.

In this way, the asserted hierarchy remains a simple, easy-to-read structure. Added semantics are provided by a set of axioms that describe each licence in detail. These axioms relate each license to a hierarchy of licence clauses.
